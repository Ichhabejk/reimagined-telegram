# Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the change. Ideally, this includes a statement in the following format: "As a (kind of user or stakeholder), I want (what feature) because (it does helps the user achieve or do what)."

> An example for having a dark mode might look like: "As a user, I want a dark mode so that the app doesn't hurt my eyes."

# Design detail

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the application to understand. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the service is used. Any new terminology should be defined here. It is greatly appreciated if you have any design images or mockups that would be help clarify your idea.

> Following the example of a dark mode feature request, you might describe that text is light, backgrounds are dark, and images have sufficient contrast with the dark backgrounds.

# Unresolved questions / Out of scope

> Are there any related issues or tangent features you consider out of scope for this issue that could be addressed in the future?
