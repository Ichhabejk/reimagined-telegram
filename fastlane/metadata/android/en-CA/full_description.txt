COVID Alert is the official exposure notification app of the Canadian government, developed by Health Canada in partnership with the Canadian Digital Service. The app serves as a digital complement to distancing, hygiene and wearing masks. It uses Bluetooth technology and the Apple/Google Exposure Notification APIs. The app is designed to help break infection chains by informing you if you were recently close to someone who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. However, at no time does it collect any personal information. Who you are and where you are remain secret - and your privacy is well-protected.
